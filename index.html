          My Journey Compiling Unreal Engine 5: Overcoming Challenges and Bugs
        </h2>

          Hello fellow game developers! I recently embarked on an exciting and
          challenging journey: compiling Unreal Engine 5 for the first time.
          This task was not just a personal goal but a challenge posed to me by
          my game developer mentor. It was a journey filled with learning,
          overcoming technical hurdles, and ultimately, a testament to the power
          of perseverance in the face of complex software challenges. In this
          post, I'll share my experience, the tools I used, and a particularly
          tricky bug I encountered and resolved.
        </p>
        <p class="post-summary">
          My adventure began with the decision to compile Unreal Engine 5 using
          the documentation provided on Unreal's official website. But I was
          first turned to this documentation from the Pro Unreal Engine Game
          Coding Udemy course. As a developer, I knew this would be a
          significant step in understanding the engine's internals and
          capabilities.
        </p>
        <p class="post-summary">
          To start, I used Visual Studio 2022 as my primary IDE, relying on its
          robust features and seamless integration with C++ projects.
          Additionally, GitHub Desktop was my choice for managing the source
          code, providing a user-friendly interface for the complex Git
          operations.
        </p>
        <p class="post-summary">
          As I dived deeper into the compilation process, I encountered an
          unexpected hurdle. It turned out that Unreal Engine needed to be
          placed in a Windows path without any spaces. This bug was not
          immediately apparent and took some time to figure out. The solution
          was to clone the repository into a path without spaces, such as
          C:\UnrealEngine5.
        </p>
        <p class="post-summary">
          After resolving the bug, the compilation process was smooth but
          lengthy. It took approximately three and a half hours to compile
          Unreal Engine 5 on my machine. I am running an AMD Ryzen 9 5900X with
          16GB of DDR4, so I was hoping the compile time would be faster. This
          duration gave me a deeper appreciation of the complexity and power of
          this game engine.
        </p>
        <p class="post-summary">
          Compiling Unreal Engine 5 was a rewarding experience that deepened my
          understanding of game development and software compilation. It was a
          blend of following detailed documentation, utilizing modern tools, and
          troubleshooting unexpected challenges. To anyone looking to undertake
          a similar journey, I say go for it! The learning and satisfaction you
          gain are well worth the effort.

          Excited to share a short video of a small proof of concept for a
          multiplayer game! ðŸŒŸðŸŽ® This game is leveraging Unity's Netcode for
          GameObjects, diving deep into the realm of seamless and synchronous
          multiplayer experiences.

        <p class="post-summary">
          The challenges I faced making this game were mostly related to server
          authoritative movement and syncing data between every player and the
          host.
